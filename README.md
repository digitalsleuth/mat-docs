# m.a.t. - A Linux mobile analysis toolkit

![](.gitbook/assets/mat-logo-crop.png)

## About m.a.t.

m.a.t. was born after I learned to use Saltstack, and realized that there was no singular repo (that I could find) which contained either a listing or a source for understanding and installing tools to conduct mobile forensic analysis. When I started to compile my list, I soon came to the conclusion that I must create a toolkit whereby these tools could be utilized and showcased.

The foundation for m.a.t. is a Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 LTS installation, either server or desktop - your choice.

## The Tools

Within this documentation you will find a set of categories for tool usage, and a list of the tools themselves, to include their original source, basic usage commands, and what they're good at.
